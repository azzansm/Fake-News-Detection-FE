# Fake News Detection Project - Frontend

Welcome to the **Fake News Detection** project! ðŸŽ‰

This is **Vania Agnes Djunaedy** and **Azza Nasima**'s final project for AI, DS, RM á¯“â˜…

This repository contains the **frontend** component needed to run the Fake News Detection project. Before you can run the code, you will need to download a couple of files and set up the project folder structure.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Download the Necessary Files

1. Download the **frontend** folder from this repository (this one).
2. Download the **backend** folder from the [Fake-News-Detection-Backend repository](https://github.com/azzansm/Fake-News-Detection-BE) to your local machine.

### Step 2: Organize the Files

Once you've downloaded both folders, your folder structure should look like this:

### Step 3: Set Up Docker

Inside the root of the **project** folder, you will find the **docker-compose.yml** file. This file helps you easily run both the frontend and backend in containers, making the setup seamless.

### Step 4: Run the Project

Now that your folder structure is set up, you can run the project using Docker. Simply run the following command from the **project** folder:

```bash
docker-compose up
